# PLOTWAVEFORM waveform plotting tool

## Synposis
**PlotWaveform plots the waveform of a WAVE-file, or vector of WAVE-data using a block by block mean calculation algorithm. WAVE-data first gets split into a number of blocks defined by the size of the axis (and therefore the available pixelwidth) which enables the most precise rendering of the data while using less CPU cycles then in normal plot calculation.**

## Usage

```[myFigure myAxes myPrint vZoomPosition OrigStartEndVal ... 
    OrigSampleValuesPos OrigSampleValuesNeg OrigTimeVec numChannels] = ... 
     PlotWaveform(szFileNameOrData, varargin)```


## Licensing

**PLOTWAVEFORM** is available under X11 (so called *MIT*) license
